These templetes are meant to be used with the wonderful Mr. Jordon's workflow. 
It was a pain tracking down all of these variables via the api page so there are txt files you can copy/paste from when making the policy or gourp. Some of these variables are dependent and i have not commented everything yet.

There is a recipe templete you can use to make your recipes fill in the blank style. a policy templete and a smart groups templete you can add these variables into.

This is all a work in progress, if i missed or miss identified something let me know.
